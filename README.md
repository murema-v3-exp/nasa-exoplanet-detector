# A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI üåå

### NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

This project was built for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge by **Murema Manganyi**, **Thando**, and **Hlali**.

Our goal is to explore how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to **automatically identify exoplanets** from space mission data ‚Äî something that has mostly been done manually in the past.

We‚Äôll be using open datasets from **NASA‚Äôs Kepler, K2, and TESS missions**, and focusing on building a model that can classify data points as **confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, or false positives**.

## üß† Project Overview

The challenge asks us to train a machine learning model on NASA‚Äôs open exoplanet datasets and design a **web interface** that makes it easier for scientists or enthusiasts to interact with the data.

Our plan:

- Start with the **Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)** dataset for initial model training.
- Experiment with supervised learning methods to classify new data points.
- Integrate a simple, interactive web interface that allows users to input new data and get predictions.
- Evaluate accuracy and see how preprocessing choices affect model performance.
